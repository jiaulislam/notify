Notification Service API Documentation
=========================================

Introduction
------------

The Notification Service API is a web service that enables sending SMS and email notifications to customers. It provides endpoints for sending notifications to single users, bulk SMS, and combined email and SMS notifications. The API is built using the FastAPI framework, which offers high performance and asynchronous task handling capabilities.

API Endpoints
-------------

1. Send Single User SMS Notification
-----------------------------------

This endpoint allows sending an SMS notification to a single user.

- URL: `/sms/single`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:

  - `message`: The content of the SMS notification.
- Response:
  - `200 OK` on successful notification submission.
  - `400 Bad Request` if the request body is invalid.
  - `500 Internal Server Error` if an error occurs during notification sending.

2. Send Bulk SMS Notification
-----------------------------

This endpoint enables sending SMS notifications to multiple users in bulk.

- URL: `/sms/bulk`
- Method: `POST`
- Request Body:
  - `recipients`: A list of phone numbers of the recipients.

If an error occurs during the notification sending process, the API will respond with a `500 Internal Server Error` status code.

Conclusion
----------

The Notification Service API allows developers to integrate SMS and email notification functionality into their applications. By leveraging FastAPI's performance and background task capabilities, the API offers efficient and asynchronous notification sending. It is recommended to monitor the delivery status of notifications and implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable notification delivery.
